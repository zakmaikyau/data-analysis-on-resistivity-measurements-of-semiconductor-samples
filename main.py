# First, we'll need to import some libraries that we'll use for the analysis
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a pandas DataFrame. This can be done using the pd.read_csv() function

df = pd.read_csv('resistivity_data.csv')

# Extract the necessary columns from the DataFrame. These may include the thickness and resistivity measurements for each sample

thickness = df['Thickness (cm)']
resistivities = df['Resistivity (Ohm-cm)']

# Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing. This may include handling missing or invalid values, and converting the data to the appropriate format
# Drop rows with missing values

df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Convert thickness and resistivities to numpy arrays
thickness = np.array(thickness)
resistivities = np.array(resistivities)

# Perform the analysis on the data. This may include fitting a curve to the data, calculating statistical quantities such as the mean and standard deviation, or visualizing the data using plots
# Fit a curve to the data using numpy's polyfit function

coefficients = np.polyfit(thickness, resistivities, deg=1)

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the resistivity measurements

mean_resistivity = np.mean(resistivities)
std_resistivity = np.std(resistivities)

# Plot the data using matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(thickness, resistivities, 'o')
plt.xlabel('Thickness (cm)')
plt.ylabel('Resistivity (Ohm-cm)')
plt.show()

# Save the results of the analysis to a file or display them to the user
# Save the coefficients of the fitted curve to a file

np.savetxt('coefficients.txt', coefficients)

# Print the mean and standard deviation of the resistivity measurements

print(f'Mean resistivity: {mean_resistivity:.2f} Ohm-cm')
print(f'Standard deviation of resistivity: {std_resistivity:.2f} Ohm-cm')
